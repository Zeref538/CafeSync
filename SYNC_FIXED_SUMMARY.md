# ✅ CafeSync Real-Time Sync - FIXED & READY!

## 🎯 **Issues Resolved:**

### **1. ✅ Removed Unused Variables**

- **Analytics**: Removed `useAuth`, `Paper`, `Tabs`, `Tab`, `user`, `selectedTab`
- **Management**: Removed `Button`, `Paper`, `Receipt`, `Timer`, `AttachMoney`, `selectedTab`
- **Inventory**: Removed `ListItem`, `ListItemText`, `ListItemSecondaryAction`, `Paper`
- **Orders**: Removed `Paper`
- **Dashboard**: Removed `Coffee`, `logout`
- **Kitchen**: Removed `ListItem`, `ListItemText`, `ListItemSecondaryAction`, `Avatar`, `Divider`, `Warning`, `Timer`, `selectedOrder`, `getStatusColor`, `getStatusIcon`

### **2. ✅ Fixed Kitchen Sync Issue**

- **Problem**: Kitchen was using `/api/orders/station/kitchen` endpoint that doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Changed Kitchen to use `/api/orders` (same as Orders component)
- **Added filtering**: Kitchen now filters orders to show only `pending`, `preparing`, `ready` statuses
- **Real-time updates**: Kitchen now properly receives and processes WebSocket updates

### **3. ✅ Merged Kitchen with Orders Backend**

- **Backend**: Kitchen now uses the same API endpoint as Orders (`/api/orders`)
- **Design**: Kept Kitchen's beautiful UI design intact
- **Functionality**: Kitchen now properly syncs with Front Counter orders
- **Filtering**: Kitchen automatically filters out completed orders

## 🚀 **Current Status:**

- ✅ **Backend Server**: Running on http://localhost:5000
- ✅ **Frontend Client**: Running on http://localhost:3000
